description: Use when working with Dash0 observability data or configuration via the dash0 CLI (the `dash0` binary) — querying logs, spans, traces, metrics, or failed checks; managing dashboards, views, check rules, synthetic checks, service level objectives (SLOs), recording rules, notification channels, spam filters, or time series aggregations; sending OTLP telemetry or deployment events; or managing teams, members, and profiles. Trigger on "Dash0", "dash0 CLI", or any of these operations.

# dash0-cli

`dash0` is a command-line interface for the [Dash0](https://www.dash0.com) observability platform. It manages Dash0 assets (dashboards, views, check rules, synthetic checks, SLOs, recording rules, notification channels, spam filters, time series aggregations), queries telemetry (logs, spans, traces, metrics, failed checks), sends telemetry via OTLP, and manages organization entities (teams, members, profiles).

**Prefer `dash0 --agent-mode <command> --help` over guessing flags.** Every command's exact, always-current flag list, aliases, and examples are available as structured JSON via `--agent-mode <command> --help` (e.g. `dash0 --agent-mode dashboards list --help`). This bundle deliberately does not duplicate flag tables — they'd go stale the moment a flag is added or renamed. Use the topics below for concepts, YAML formats, and workflows that `--help` output can't express; use `--agent-mode <command> --help` for the exact flags to pass.

## Command taxonomy

| Category | Commands | Characteristics |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Authentication | `login`, `logout` | Browser-based OAuth 2.0 + PKCE; per-profile |
| Configuration | `config profiles`, `config show` | Profile management, no API calls |
| Asset CRUD | `dashboards`, `views`, `check-rules`, `synthetic-checks`, `slos`, `recording-rules`, `notification-channels`, `spam-filters`, `time-series-aggregations`, `apply` | File-based input, `--dry-run`, five standard subcommands |
| Query | `logs query`, `spans query`, `traces get`, `metrics instant`, `failed-checks query` | Time range, filters |
| Send | `logs send`, `spans send` | OTLP-based, repeatable attribute flags |
| Daemon | `otlp proxy` | Long-running, signal-driven shutdown, experimental |
| Organizational | `teams`, `members`, `notification-channels` | Flag-based input, no dataset, experimental |
| Raw HTTP | `api` | Passthrough to any Dash0 API endpoint, experimental |
| Agent tooling | `skill install`, `skill show` | No API calls; local filesystem only; not gated by `--experimental`; no `-o`/JSON output |

## Prerequisites

Every command that talks to the Dash0 API or OTLP endpoint needs credentials, resolved in this order (first match wins): environment variables (`DASH0_API_URL`, `DASH0_OTLP_URL`, `DASH0_AUTH_TOKEN`, `DASH0_DATASET`), CLI flags (`--api-url`, `--otlp-url`, `--auth-token`, `--dataset`), then the selected profile (`--profile` flag → `DASH0_PROFILE` env var → the active profile on disk). See the `config` and `login` topics for profile management and OAuth authentication.

## Global flags

`--api-url`, `--otlp-url`, `--auth-token`, `--dataset`, `--profile`, `--agent-mode` (env: `DASH0_AGENT_MODE`), `--color` (`semantic` or `none`), `--experimental`/`-X`, `--max-retries`, `--no-skill-hint` (env: `DASH0_NO_SKILL_HINT` — suppress the "start with `dash0 skill show` … or run `dash0 skill install`" hint stitched onto errors; `dash0 skill show` (no arg) prints the entry point with a full topic index, `dash0 skill show <topic>` drills into one topic without writing files, and `dash0 skill install` adds a persistent bundle to the project). Run `dash0 --agent-mode --help` for the full, current list.

### Agent mode

Agent mode optimizes the CLI for AI agents: JSON output by default, structured `--help`, JSON errors, no confirmation prompts, no color. It auto-activates when a known AI agent environment variable is detected (`CLAUDE_CODE`, `CURSOR_AGENT`, `CODEX`, `GITHUB_COPILOT`, and others), or can be forced with `--agent-mode` / `DASH0_AGENT_MODE=1`.

## How asset commands work

All nine asset types (`dashboards`, `check-rules`, `synthetic-checks`, `slos`, `views`, `recording-rules`, `notification-channels`, `spam-filters`, `time-series-aggregations`) share the same five subcommands: `list`, `get`, `create` (alias `add`), `update`, `delete` (alias `remove`). Output formats are `table`, `wide`, `json`, `yaml`, `csv` (query commands use `table`/`json`/`csv` only). `create`/`update` accept `-f <file>` (or `-f -` for stdin) and `--dry-run`.

`dash0 apply -f <file|directory>` provides create-or-update semantics across all asset types in one command, and (experimentally, via `--since <ref>`) delete semantics based on git history — see the `apply` topic.

### Asset identifiers and idempotent upsert

Every asset type accepts a user-defined identifier in its YAML/JSON document. When present, both `create` and `apply` perform an **upsert** (PUT) against that identifier — the asset is created on the first call and replaced on every subsequent call, which is what makes GitOps/CI workflows idempotent. When absent, both perform a plain create (POST) and the server assigns a fresh ID on each invocation, so repeated runs produce duplicates. The identifier field location varies by kind:

| Kind | Identifier field |
|------|------------------|
| `Dashboard` | `metadata.dash0Extensions.id` |
| `PersesDashboard` | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/id"]` |
| `CheckRule` | top-level `id` |
| `PrometheusRule` (alerting or recording) | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/id"]` (a CRD with 2+ alerting rules derives a distinct id per alert instead: `<label>--<slug of "<group> - <alert>">`) |
| `SyntheticCheck` | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/id"]` |
| `View` | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/id"]` |
| `SLO` | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/origin"]` — SLO IDs are server-assigned (`slo_<ulid>`), so origin is the only client-settable key; `metadata.labels["dash0.com/id"]` is used only when origin is absent |
| `Dash0SpamFilter` | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/id"]` (`dash0.com/origin` takes precedence when both are present) |
| `Dash0NotificationChannel` | no ID field — `metadata.labels["dash0.com/origin"]` is the upsert key |
| `Dash0Team` | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/origin"]` (`metadata.labels["dash0.com/id"]` when origin is absent) |
| `Dash0TimeSeriesAggregation` | `metadata.labels["dash0.com/origin"]`, and it is **mandatory** — the API rejects an aggregation without one, so there is no POST fallback. A `dash0.com/id` in the body is ignored. Origins are unique per organization while each aggregation belongs to one dataset, so one document cannot serve two datasets |

**Origin vs ID — do not conflate them.** *ID* is the user-defined external identifier described above. *Origin* (`dash0.com/origin` label) records which system is the authoritative source of truth for an asset (`dash0-cli`, `terraform`, `ui`, `operator`). Which of the two is the upsert key depends on the kind, and the split follows the shape of the underlying API rather than being a list of exceptions:

- **Origin is the upsert key** for the kinds whose API is built around API-managed resources: notification channels, spam filters, SLOs, teams, and time series aggregations. The CLI reads the origin label off the document and upserts against it (`PUT /api/<kind>/{origin}`). Notification channels have no user-settable ID at all. For SLOs origin is not just accepted but recommended: the server assigns SLO IDs, so `dash0.com/origin` is the only way to make a hand-written SLO document idempotent. For time series aggregations it is mandatory: the API rejects a document without one.
- **ID is the upsert key, and origin is provenance only** for views, check rules, recording rules, and synthetic checks. The CLI strips `dash0.com/origin` before sending these documents, so an `apply` never claims ownership of an asset managed by Terraform or the Kubernetes operator.
- **Dashboards** use `metadata.dash0Extensions.id`; the sibling `metadata.dash0Extensions.origin` field is deprecated in favor of it, so never upsert a dashboard by origin.

When `list -o yaml` or `get -o yaml` exports an existing asset, the server-assigned ID is rendered into the correct field, so an export → edit → `apply` (or `update`) round-trips through the identifier automatically.

## Filter syntax

Query commands (`logs query`, `spans query`, `metrics instant --filter`, `failed-checks query`) accept `--filter` expressions in the form `key [operator] value` (operator defaults to `is` when omitted), or JSON filter criteria copied from the Dash0 UI. Multiple `--filter` flags combine with AND logic.

| Operator | Alias | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `is` | `=` | Exact match (default) |
| `is_not` | `!=` | Not equal |
| `contains` / `does_not_contain` | | Substring match / negation |
| `starts_with` / `does_not_start_with` | | Prefix match / negation |
| `ends_with` / `does_not_end_with` | | Suffix match / negation |
| `matches` / `does_not_match` | `~` / `!~` | Regular expression match / negation |
| `gt` / `gte` / `lt` / `lte` | `>` / `>=` / `<` / `<=` | Numeric comparison |
| `is_set` / `is_not_set` | | Attribute present / absent |
| `is_one_of` / `is_not_one_of` | | Matches any / none of space-separated values |
| `is_any` | | Matches any value |

Common attribute keys: `service.name`, `otel.log.severity.number`, `otel.log.severity.range`, `otel.log.body`, `otel.span.status.code`, `otel.trace.id`. Valid `otel.log.severity.range` values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `UNKNOWN`.

## Custom columns

`--column` (repeatable) selects which columns appear in `table`/`csv` output, replacing the default set entirely. Each command has short aliases (e.g. `time`, `severity`, `body` for `logs query`; `duration`, `status`, `service` for `spans query`) — see each topic for its alias table — and any OTLP attribute key can also be used directly as a column. Not supported with `-o json`.

## Precision mode (adaptive sampling)

By default the API applies adaptive sampling to log and span queries for speed on large datasets. Pass `--precision disabled` to `logs query` or `spans query` for deterministic, complete results (higher latency) on narrow lookups like a specific trace or request ID; `--precision adaptive` is the explicit default. `traces get` always disables sampling and doesn't accept the flag; `metrics instant` and `failed-checks query` don't honor it.

## Common workflows for AI agents

### Set up credentials from environment variables

```bash
export DASH0_API_URL=https://api.us-west-2.aws.dash0.com DASH0_OTLP_URL=https://ingress.us-west-2.aws.dash0.com DASH0_AUTH_TOKEN=auth_xxx DASH0_DATASET=default
```
Then any command picks them up without flags, e.g. `dash0 dashboards list` or `dash0 logs query --from now-1h`.

### Export an asset, modify it, and re-apply

```bash
dash0 dashboards get <id> -o yaml > dashboard.yaml
```
Edit the file, then either `dash0 dashboards update -f dashboard.yaml` (ID read from the file) or `dash0 apply -f dashboard.yaml` (auto-detects create vs. update).

### Bulk export and re-apply all assets of one type

```bash
dash0 dashboards list -o yaml > all-dashboards.yaml
dash0 apply -f all-dashboards.yaml
```
The YAML output is a multi-document stream, ready to replay across environments.

### Send a deployment event

```bash
dash0 logs send "Deployment v2.3.0 completed" \
    --event-name dash0.deployment \
    --severity-number 9 \
    --resource-attribute service.name=my-service \
    --resource-attribute deployment.environment.name=production \
    --log-attribute deployment.status=succeeded
```

### Query errors in the last hour

```bash
dash0 logs query --from now-1h --filter "otel.log.severity.range is_one_of ERROR WARN" --limit 200
```

### Non-interactive deletion (for automation)

Always pass `--force` to skip the confirmation prompt: `dash0 dashboards delete <id> --force`.
With `--force`, an already-deleted asset is treated as idempotent success — the command exits 0 and prints a short "already deleted" line to stderr. Without `--force`, a missing asset still surfaces as a non-zero exit with a "not found" error. This is uniform across every `delete` subcommand and every `remove`-shaped variant (`members remove`, `teams remove-members`); in the multi-target variants the check runs per member so one concurrently-removed member does not fail the whole call.

### Validate assets before applying

```bash
dash0 apply -f assets/ --dry-run
```

### Sync a directory to match its state as of a git ref (experimental)

`apply --since <ref>` deletes assets removed from `-f`'s contents since `<ref>`, in addition to the usual create/update behavior. Requires `--experimental`/`-X` and `-f`'s target to be inside a git repository:

```bash
dash0 --experimental apply -f assets/ --since HEAD~1 --force
```

Preview the plan first with `--dry-run` — see the `apply` topic for the full reference, including the GitHub Actions invocation pattern and ref-resolution edge cases.

## Keeping this skill up to date

If the dash0-cli version this skill shipped with feels stale (missing a command you can see in `dash0 --help`), run `dash0 skill install` again to refresh it from the currently installed binary.
